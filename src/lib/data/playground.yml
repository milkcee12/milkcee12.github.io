      Adam Bahri from The Guy Upstairs! Totally sane, handsome, green flag boyfriend
      material. Tried a more comic-like sketching style where all the shading is done
      before you add any colors.

    desc:
      A complete redraw of an older piece! Although I draw a lot of people these
      days, I used to love drawing backgrounds and especially clouds. I wanted to try
      my hand at Studio Ghibli vibes in this piece.
